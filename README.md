- 👋 Hi, I’m @Carl-Nixon
- 👀 I’m interested in life, the universe and everything. On a more down to earth level I'm establishing myself as a freelance VBA developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL and Power BI. All while studying for a BSc (Honours) in Computing and IT at the Open University.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on freelancing, VBA or any of the subjects I'm learning above.
- 📫 I can be reached at carlnixonsemail@gmail.com
