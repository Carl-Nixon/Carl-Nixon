👋 Hi, I’m @Carl-Nixon

👀 I’m interested in life, the universe and everything. On a more down to earth level I'm establishing myself as a freelance VBA developer. You can see how this is going on my website www.excel-expert.co.uk

🌱 I’m currently learning Python, SQL and Power BI. All while studying for a BSc (Honours) in Computing and IT at the Open University.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on freelancing, VBA or any of the subjects I'm learning above.

📫 I can be reached at carl@excel-expert.co.uk

🧑‍💼 You can also find me on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/carljnixon/

❓ If you have any questions, ideas, or comments please get in touch
